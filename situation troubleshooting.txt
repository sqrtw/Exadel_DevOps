1) check internet access via ping 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1
	if there is no access, then:
	1.1) check setting of network connection - static or dhcp
	1.2) check ping to the router
	1.3) check internet on the router
	1.4) check nat settings on the router or port mapping or dhcp setting
2) check if the port is open from sites like portchecker.co
	if there is no access:
	2.1) need check config on server side
3) if you have access to the internet and no access to the ssh check/change ssh client or check encryption setting or disable firewall/av
4) if all of the above did not work, maybe your company is using ngfw/utm with blocking policy ssh to outside.
